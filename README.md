# SoundMixer

This is a project I created in 5 days mostly to showcase my code style in Swift.

This simple app loads data locally from a JSON file into Realm and shows the loaded models in a collection view.

Users can interact with the collection view to play/pause individual sound assets.

Very basic animations are included in the UI just to make the app a notch beyond being fully static and boring!

As for design pattern, VIPER has been implemented to showcase a fully functional separation between app data and views.

For the UI, it uses auto layout through the code.

There are currently no network calls or unit tests included.

This app has been tested on iOS Simulators only.

ENJOY !!!
