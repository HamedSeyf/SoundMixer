# SoundMixer

This is a project I created in 3 days mostly to showcase my code style in Swift.

This simple app loads data locally from a JSON file into Realm and shows the loaded models in a collection view.

Users can interact with the collection view to play/pause individual sound assets.

Very basic animations are included in the UI just to make the app a notch beyond being fully static and boring!

For the UI, it uses auto layout through the code.

There are currently no network calls or unit tests included.

ENJOY !!!
